# UFO_Singhtings_Challenge

## Objective

Dana would like to provide a more in-depth analysis of the UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Using Javascript, I'm adding filters for city, state, country, and shape along with with the data of the sighting

## Results

Using JavaScript, I've created a new function to loop through the dataset and keep only the results that match the search criteria, where the webpage will be updated with the search criteria aftering hitting "Enter"

## Summary

The main drawback of the site is the person looking for the UFO sightings would already have to know which date, shapes, or cities to look for specifically in order for the filteration to work. Some shapes listed may not be something a user would normally use. A drop-down arrow displaying the list of "shapes" and "cities" would make it easier for the user to navigate better throughout the site to find what they are looking for.
